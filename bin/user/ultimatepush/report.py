"""Leave a report where somebody can find it.

When a station sends something the driver does not know, the useful thing is the raw
upload. Getting hold of it should not mean reconfiguring the console and waiting for
an interval, so the driver writes it out itself the first time it sees a field it
cannot place.

The result is one file, ready to paste into an issue, with the station's PASSKEY
already replaced.
