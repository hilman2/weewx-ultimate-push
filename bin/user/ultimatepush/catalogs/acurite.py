"""What an Acurite bridge forwards, and where it belongs in WeeWX.

The bridge sends one request per sensor, not one per station. A frame says which
sensor it came from in `sensor`, and what kind of sensor that is in `mt`, and then
carries three or four readings. So a station with a 5-in-1 and three towers produces
four requests every eighteen seconds, each of them with `tempf` in it meaning
something different.

That is why the readings are qualified before they reach this catalog. The 5-in-1 is
the station and keeps the plain names; everything else is prefixed with what it is and
which sensor it was, and waits for the user to say where it goes. Nothing else can:
which tower is on the north wall and which is in the greenhouse is not in the payload.

Field names and their meanings come from the interceptor driver by Matthew Wall, which
captured them from real bridges. GPLv3, like this.
