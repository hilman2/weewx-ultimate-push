"""What a LaCrosse LW30x gateway forwards, and where it belongs in WeeWX.

Two-letter names, one request per sensor, and a `ch` that says which channel the
sensor is on. Channel 1 is the station; anything above it is a sensor whose placement
only the user knows, so the readings are qualified with their channel before they get
here.

Half the parameters have no documented meaning. They are listed in UNDOCUMENTED rather
than left out, so that the report says a gateway sent them and somebody who has one
can work out what they are.

Field names, meanings and units come from the interceptor driver by Matthew Wall,
which captured them from an LW301. GPLv3, like this.
