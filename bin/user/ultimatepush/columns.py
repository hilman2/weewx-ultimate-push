"""Which database columns a station actually needs.

A reading only survives the archive interval if the table has a column for it. The
standard schema has 113 of them, and Ecowitt hardware can fill four times that, so
something has to give.

Two ways to handle it. Ship a schema with every field anyone might own, which is what
the alternatives do, and carry four hundred columns for the twelve sensors in the
garden. Or look at what the hardware actually sends and add those.

This does the second. It needs a payload, not a catalog, which is why it lives next to
the listener rather than in the installer.
