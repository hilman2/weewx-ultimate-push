"""Listen once, and say what the hardware is sending.

Run this before wiring anything up, or when a sensor is missing from the reports:

    python -m user.ultimatepush --port 8000

It waits for one upload, works out which protocol sent it, then prints what arrived,
what the driver could not place, the commands that would give the readings somewhere
to live, and which of those fields already hold somebody else's history. Nothing is
changed, and WeeWX does not have to be stopped as long as this uses a different port.

Every protocol the driver knows is listened for, and each one is answered the way its
hardware expects, so a console will not decide the upload failed and stop.
