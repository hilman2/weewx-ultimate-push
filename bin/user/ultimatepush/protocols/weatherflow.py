"""The WeatherFlow UDP protocol.

The odd one out, in three ways.

    It broadcasts.  A Tempest hub sends JSON datagrams to the whole local network on
    port 50222. Nothing is posted, nothing is answered, and no server is configured
    anywhere: the hub does this whether or not anybody is listening. Which also means
    there is nothing to keep strangers out with, beyond the network itself.

    The readings are positional.  An observation is an array, and index 7 is the air
    temperature because index 7 is the air temperature. See catalogs/weatherflow.py.

    The rain is already a difference.  Every other protocol here sends running
    counters that StdDelta has to subtract. A Tempest sends the millimetres since its
    last report, which is what WeeWX means by 'rain'. Differencing it again would
    record almost no rain at all.

Because it needs a second port and a second transport, it is not switched on by
'protocols = auto'. Name it to open the socket.
