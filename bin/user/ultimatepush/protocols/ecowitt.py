"""The Ecowitt protocol.

What a gateway or console sends when *Customized* is set to protocol *Ecowitt* in the
WSView app: a POST with an urlencoded form body, every reading in imperial units, the
station named by a PASSKEY derived from its own MAC address.

Ecowitt hardware is stricter than most about the answer. It wants the JSON below, and
an upload it cannot acknowledge is retried and eventually dropped.

The catalog is generated. See catalogs/ecowitt.py.
