"""The LaCrosse LW30x gateway.

Like the Acurite bridge, it posts to its maker's servers and cannot be told otherwise,
so reading it means answering for those on your own network. See docs/Hardware.md.

One request per sensor, two-letter parameter names, and a `ch` saying which channel
the sensor is on. Channel 1 is the station and everything above it is a sensor whose
placement only the user knows, so the readings are qualified with their channel and
the catalog puts channels two and up on the extra fields.

Half of what an LW30x sends has no established meaning. Those parameters are named in
the catalog's UNDOCUMENTED and kept out of the packet: a column of numbers nobody can
label is worse than no column.

The other LaCrosse gateway, the GW1000U, is not read here. It does not send name and
value pairs at all: it registers with the server, is told its serial number, its ping
interval and its display brightness, and then exchanges binary frames. That is a
protocol rather than a dialect, and it is not this one.

Field names, meanings, units and sample frames come from the interceptor driver by
Matthew Wall, which captured them from an LW301.
