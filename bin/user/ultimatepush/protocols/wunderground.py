"""The Weather Underground upload protocol.

A GET to /weatherstation/updateweatherstation.php, the readings in the query string,
the station named by ID and PASSWORD. It is the oldest of the protocols here and the
only one where the hardware can present a shared secret, because PASSWORD is part of
every upload.

The field list is in catalogs/wunderground.py, derived from the specification as
Weather Underground published it.

Three things about this protocol are traps, and all three come from real uploads
rather than from the specification:

    A device answers to more than the specification.  Fine Offset firmwares add
    weeklyrainin, windchillf, lowbatt, absbaromin and others. They are the same
    protocol on the same endpoint, so they are in the same catalog.

    There is a metric dialect.  The same hardware under 'Weather logger' or 'HP1001'
    firmware sends intemp, outtemp, absbaro, light in Celsius, hPa and lux. Different
    names, different units, same endpoint. See METRIC_FIELDS.

    baromin means two different things.  Sea-level pressure on most firmwares,
    station pressure on WH2600GEN_V2.2.5 and WH2650A_V1.2.1. Nothing in the payload
    distinguishes them, so it is contested and waits for the user.
