"""The Ambient Weather protocol, as a console sends it to a custom server.

Ambient hardware descends from the same Fine Offset design as Ecowitt's, and it
shows: a PASSKEY built from the MAC address, a stationtype, imperial units, the same
POST of an urlencoded form. What differs is the vocabulary. Ambient says `soilhum1`
where Ecowitt says `soilmoisture1`, `battout` where Ecowitt says `wh65batt`,
`lightning_day` where Ecowitt says `lightning_num`, and it has `relay1` to `relay10`
and the AQIN indoor air module, which Ecowitt has no equivalent of.

That is why it is a protocol of its own rather than a dialect of Ecowitt's. Reading an
Ambient upload with the Ecowitt catalog does not fail loudly. It silently drops the
soil probes and the batteries, which is exactly the failure this driver exists to stop.

The two are told apart by the station type, which Ambient consoles always send and
which always begins with AMBWeather.

The catalog is generated. See catalogs/ambient.py and tools/import_ambient.py.
