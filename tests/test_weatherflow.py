"""WeatherFlow, from the datagrams in the official reference.

Every fixture here is an example out of WeatherFlow's own UDP reference, unchanged.
That matters more than usual: the readings are positional, so a mapping that is off by
one puts the humidity in the pressure column and looks entirely plausible.
