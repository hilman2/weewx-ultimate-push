"""Telling one protocol from another.

Everything downstream depends on getting this right. A Weather Underground upload read
with the Ecowitt catalog does not fail: it silently drops the pressure, the indoor
sensors and the hourly rain, and records the rest. That is the failure mode this whole
driver exists to prevent, so it is tested from captured payloads rather than from
made-up ones.
