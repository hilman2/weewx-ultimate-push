"""The two bridges: Acurite and LaCrosse.

Both are the same shape of problem. One request per sensor, all of them carrying the
same field names, and nothing in any of them saying where that sensor hangs. So both
qualify their readings before mapping, and both leave the placement to the user.

Every fixture is a frame captured off real hardware, by way of the interceptor driver.
