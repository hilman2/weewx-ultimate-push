"""The Ambient Weather protocol.

Ambient hardware descends from the same Fine Offset design as Ecowitt's and looks
almost identical on the wire. Almost is the problem: it says `soilhum1` where Ecowitt
says `soilmoisture1`, `battout` where Ecowitt says `wh65batt`, and `lightning_day`
where Ecowitt says `lightning_num`.

Read with the Ecowitt catalog, an Ambient upload does not fail. The temperature and
the wind arrive, and the soil probes, the batteries and the lightning sensor are
dropped without a word. These tests are what stops that.
